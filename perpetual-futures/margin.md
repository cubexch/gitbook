# Margining

## Margin Modes

### Cross Margin
In cross margin mode, all positions share the same margin balance. This mode offers more efficient capital usage but comes with higher risk as all positions share the same collateral.

### Isolated Margin
Isolated margin mode allows traders to allocate specific margin amounts to individual positions, limiting potential losses to the allocated margin.

## Margin Requirements

### Initial Margin
Initial margin is the minimum amount required to open a position. The requirement is calculated based on the position size and leverage used.

## Maintenance Margin
Maintenance margin is the minimum equity required to keep a position open. If account equity falls below the maintenance margin requirement, the position risks liquidation.

## Margin Calculation
Initial Margin = Position Value / Leverage
Maintenance Margin = Position Value Ã— Maintenance Margin Rate

## Cross vs. Isolated Margin
- **Cross Margin**: Shared margin balance across all positions
- **Isolated Margin**: Separate margin allocated to each position
