# Introduction to Perpetual Futures

Perpetual futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiration date. Unlike traditional futures contracts, perpetual futures can be held indefinitely and use a funding rate mechanism to keep the perpetual price closely aligned with the underlying spot price.
