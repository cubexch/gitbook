# Entry Price and PNL

## Entry Price Calculation
- Single Entry: The price at which a position is opened
- Multiple Entries: Weighted average of entry prices
- Position Modifications: How adding or reducing affects entry price

## PNL Calculations
### Unrealized PNL
For Long Positions:
- Unrealized PNL = (Current Price - Entry Price) × Position Size

For Short Positions:
- Unrealized PNL = (Entry Price - Current Price) × Position Size

### Realized PNL
Calculated when positions are closed or partially closed.
