# Liquidations

## Liquidation Process
Liquidation occurs when a trader's position cannot maintain the minimum required margin level. The liquidation process helps prevent negative account equity and maintains market stability.

## Liquidation Price Calculation
The liquidation price is calculated based on:
- Position Size
- Entry Price
- Maintenance Margin Requirement
- Account Balance

## Partial Liquidations
In some cases, positions may be partially liquidated to bring the account back above maintenance margin requirements.

## Liquidation Fees
Details about fees charged during the liquidation process.

# Auto-Deleveraging (ADL)

## ADL Mechanism
Auto-deleveraging is triggered when the insurance fund is depleted and cannot cover the losses from liquidated positions.

## ADL Priority
Positions are deleveraged based on:
1. Profit and Leverage
2. Position Size
3. Time of Entry

## ADL Indicator
The ADL indicator shows the likelihood of a position being selected for deleveraging.
